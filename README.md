# Always Autocomplete

This is a Chrome Extension that removes `autocomplete` and `autofill` attributes
from all elements on any page.

It contains no settings so will run on all pages. [Autocomplete On!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autocomplete-on/kkffidhhikbopjomeeaihconieppiaan?hl=en-GB)
by Tyler Elliott provides more functionality but doesn't provide it's source.

For security reasons, I can't run extensions that I can't see the source for so
I built this extension as an alternative.
